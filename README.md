In a lean approach, we want to help you to avoid mistakes and to improve your productivity.
And we noticed than some mistakes are often repeated by developers. The hard thing is to share the knowledge to avoid them.

## What is a Poka Yoke?

Poka Yoke is a Japanese term that means "mistake-proofing" or "inadvertent error prevention". A poka-yoke is any mechanism in a lean manufacturing process that helps an equipment operator avoid (yokeru) mistakes (poka). Its purpose is to eliminate product defects by preventing, correcting, or drawing attention to human errors as they occur.

## The idea behind this repository

The idea is to share with you some poka yoke that we have identified during our developer journey. And the best way to do it is to help you having the best tool on your machine.

To do so the first idea that came to our mind was to share our IDE or text editor configuration files.
